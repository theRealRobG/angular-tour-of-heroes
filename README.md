# angular-tour-of-heroes

This is the Angular tour of heroes tutorial (found [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)),
but done using the Angular WebPack bootstrap (which I completed and added [here](https://github.com/theRealRobG/angular-webpack-boilerplate)),
and with a different folder structure.
